  <p class="introduction">
    Hello there. My name is Albert, and my favorite animal is a cat. My hobbies are eating around the city and biking.
    I was a Computer Science Major who wanted to get into Frontend development, but I changed my major to New Media and Digital Design because
    I like the creative aspect of doing something like UX design.
